SLIC Watch provides a CloudWatch Dashboard and Alarms for:

 1. AWS Lambda
 2. API Gateway
 3. Step Functions
 4. DynamoDB Tables
 5. Kinesis Data Streams
 6. SQS Queues

Currently, SLIC Watch is available as a Serverless Framework plugin.

## Installation

```
npm install serverless-slic-watch-plugin --save-dev
```

## Configuration


The `topic` configuration must be configured with the ARN of an SNS Topic.
Alarm configuration is _cascading_. This means that configuration properties are automatically propagated from parent to children nodes (unless an override is present at the given node).
Supported options along with their defaults are shown below.


```yaml

## A note on CloudWatch cost

This plugin creates additional CloudWatch resources that, apart from a limited free tier, have an associated cost.
Depending on what you enable, SLIC Watch creates one dashboard and multiple alarms. The number of each depend on the number of resources in your stack and the number of stacks you have.

Check out the AWS [CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) page to understand the cost impact of creating CloudWatch resources.

## Releasing a new version

In order to release a new version of the project:

  - update the package version in the top level `package.json`
  - run `npm run lerna:sync` to synchronise that version across all the sub packages
  - push these changes
  - draft a new release in GitHub (the CI will do the publish to npm)
