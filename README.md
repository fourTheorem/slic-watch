SLIC Watch provides a CloudWatch Dashboard and Alarms for:

 1. AWS Lambda
 2. API Gateway
 3. Step Functions
 4. DynamoDB Tables
 5. Kinesis Data Streams (available for Lambda consumers, more coming soon)
 6. SQS Queues (Coming soon)

Currently, SLIC Watch is available as a Serverless Framework plugin.

## Installation

```
npm install serverless-slic-watch-plugin --save-dev
```

## Configuration


The `topic` configuration must be configured with the ARN of an SNS Topic.
Alarm configuration is _cascading_. This means that configuration properties are automatically propagated from parent to children nodes (unless an override is present at the given node).
Supported options along with their defaults are shown below.


```yaml

        # to alert failures in these scenarios.

## Releasing a new version

In order to release a new version of the project:

  - update the package version in the top level `package.json`
  - run `npm run lerna:sync` to synchronise that version across all the sub packages
  - push these changes
  - draft a new release in GitHub (the CI will do the publish to npm)
