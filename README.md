SLIC Watch provides a CloudWatch Dashboard and Alarms for:

 1. AWS Lambda
 2. API Gateway
 3. DynamoDB
 4. Kinesis Data Streams
 5. SQS Queues
 6. Step Functions

Currently, SLIC Watch is available as a Serverless Framework plugin.

## Getting Started

1. üì¶ Install the plugin:
```
npm install serverless-slic-watch-plugin --save-dev
```
2. üñãÔ∏è Add the plugin to the `plugins` section of `serverless.yml`:
```
plugins:
  - serverless-slic-watch-plugin
```
3. ü™õ _Optionally_, add some configuration for the plugin to the `custom -> slicWatch` section of `serverless.yml`.
Here, you can specify a reference to the SNS topic for alarms. This is optional, but it's usually something you want
so you can receive alarm notifications via email, Slack, etc.

```
custom:
  slicWatch:
    topicArn: {'Fn::Ref': myTopic}
```
See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for more detailed instructions on fine tuning SLIC Watch to your needs.


4. üö¢ Deploy your application in the usual way, for example:
```
sls deploy
```
5. üëÄ Head to the CloudWatch section of the AWS Console to check out your new dashboards üìä and alarms ‚è∞ !

## Features

CloudWatch Alarms and Dashboard widgets are created for all supported resources in the CloudFormation stack generated by The Serverless Framework. This includes generated resources as well as resources specifed explicitly in the `resources` section.
Any feature can be configured or disabled completely - see the section on [configuration](#configuration) to see how.

### Lambda Functions

Lambda Function alarms are created for:
1. _Errors_
2. _Throttles_, as a percentage of the number of invocations
3. _Duration_, as a percentage of the function's configured timeout
4. _Invocations_, disabled by default
5. _IteratorAge_, for function's triggered by an [Event Source Mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html)

Lambda dashboard widgets show:

|Errors|Throttles|Duration Average, P95 and Maximum|
|--|--|--|
|![Errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/lambdaErrors.png)|![Throttles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/lambdaThrottles.png) |![Throttles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/lambdaDurationP95.png) |
|**Invocations**|**Concurrent Executions**|**Iterator Age**|

### API Gateway

API Gateway alarms are created for:
1. 5XX Errors
2. 4XX Errors
3. Latency

API Gateway dashboard widgets show:

|5XX Errors|4XX Errors|Latency|Count|
|--|--|--|--|
|![5XX Errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/api5xx.png)|![4XX Errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/api4xx.png) |![Latency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/apiLatency.png) |![Count](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/apiCount.png) |

### DynamoDB

DynamoDB alarms are created for:
1. Read Throttle Events (Table and GSI)
2. Write Throttle Events (Table and GSI)
3. UserErrors
4. SystemErrors

Dashboard widgets are created for tables and GSIs:

|ReadThrottleEvents (Table)| WriteThrottleEvent (Table)|
|---|---|
|![WriteThrottleEvents Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/dynamodbTableWriteThrottle.png)|![WriteThrottleEvents Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/dynamodbTableWriteThrottle.png)|

### Kinesis Data Streams
Kinesis data stream alarms are created for:
1. Iterator Age
2. Read Provisioned Throughput Exceeded
2. Write Provisioned Throughput Exceeded
3. PutRecord.Success
3. PutRecords.Success
4. GetRecords.Success

Kinesis data stream dashboard widgets show:

|Iterator Age|Read Provisioned Throughput Exceeded|Write Provisioned Throughput Exceeded|
|--|--|--|
|![Iterator Age](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/kinesisIteratorAge.png)|![Provisioned Throughput Exceeded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/kinesisProvisionedThroughput.png) |![Put/Get Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/kinesisPutGetSuccess.png) |

### SQS Queues

SQS Queue alarms are create for:
1. Age Of Oldest Message (disabled by default). If enabled, a threshold in seconds should be specified.
2. In Flight Messages Percentage. This is a percentage of the [AWS hard limits](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/) (20,000 messages for FIFO queues and 120,000 for standard queues).

SQS queue dashboard widgets show:

|Messages Sent, Received and Deleted|Messages Visible|Age of Oldest Message|
|--|--|--|
|![Messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/sqsMessages.png)|![Messages Visible](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/sqsMessagesInQueue.png) |![Oldest Message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fourtheorem/slic-watch/main/docs/sqsOldestMessage.png) |

### Step Functions

Step Function alarms are created for:
1. Execution Throttled
2. Executions Failed
3. Executions Timed Out

The dashboard contains one widget per Step Function:
|ExecutionsFailed ExecutionThrottled, ExecutionsTimedOut|
|--|

## Configuration

The `topic` may be optionally provided as an SNS Topic destination for all alarms.  If you omit the topic, alarms are still created but are not sent to any destination.
Alarm configuration is _cascading_. This means that configuration properties are automatically propagated from parent to children nodes (unless an override is present at the given node).
Supported options along with their defaults are shown below.


```yaml
# ...

custom:
  slicWatch:

## A note on CloudWatch cost

This plugin creates additional CloudWatch resources that, apart from a limited free tier, have an associated cost.
Depending on what you enable, SLIC Watch creates one dashboard and multiple alarms. The number of each depend on the number of resources in your stack and the number of stacks you have.

Check out the AWS [CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) page to understand the cost impact of creating CloudWatch resources.
